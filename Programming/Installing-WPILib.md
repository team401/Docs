The WPILib is the core FRC library that the programming team uses to create code for the robots. By installing the WPILib you get:
- VSCode, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) that works best with the WPILib
- Java JDK
- Gradle
- Tools (SmartDashboard, Shuffleboard, etc.)

Follow the instructions in the [WPILib Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) to install the WPILib and VS Code (we use the recommended settings).
