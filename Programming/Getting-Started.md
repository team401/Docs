## Create GitHub Account

First, you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com) in order to access the code repositories the team uses. Give your username to the lead programmer or a programming mentor and they will add you to the GitHub organization.

## Install Required Software

Next, download the required software:
- [Installing Git](/Programming/Installing-Git.html)
- [Installing WPILib](/Programming/Installing-WPILib.html)

After these programs are installed, your development environment is ready to use.

### Install Optional Software

Consider installing some of the [Optional Software](/Programming/Optional-Software.html) as needed. Normally you do not need to do this unless you are the lead programmer or if you are working on specific hardware.

## Read Software Development Workflow

With a correctly configured development environment, follow the [Software Development Workflow](/Programming/Software-Workflow.html) while working on code.
