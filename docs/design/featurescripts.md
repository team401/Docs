# Featurescripts

Onshape has its own scripting language to create custom features to automate aspects of design called [Featurescript](https://www.onshape.com/features/custom-features "Onshape Featurescript Page"){:target="_blank"}. There are a lot of featurescripts (what we call the custom features) that make designing for FRC much easier.

## How To Install Featurescripts

1. Open any Onshape document and go inside of a part studio
2. Click the rightmost button on the toolbar that looks like this: ![add custom feature button](/images/design/addCustomFeatures.webp)
    - **Note:** If you have previously added any Featurescripts one of those may show up as the right most icon. In that case click the dropdown to show the add button.
3. Paste the link of the document with the featurescript(s) in it into the search bar
    - **Note:** Some of the below featurescripts exist in the same document, so you can add multiple from the same link.

4. Select the featurescript(s) you want to add to your profile, then exit the box. They will be accessible in all documents from then on in the same drop-down in the toolbar where you added the feature.

!!! Note "Adding Featurescripts while in an Onshape Document"
    When viewing a tab in a document that uses custom features, you can click a button near the top left that says 'custom features'. From here you can add custom features used in the document to your profile.

## Troubleshooting and Updating Featurescripts

If a featurescript is not working as expected, the current version might be broken. You might have to update the featurescript. If it needs updating, the feature will show a blue icon to the right of it that, when hovered over, will say "change version of linked document."

1. The first way to update it is by individually by right clicking the feature you want updated in the feature list and clicking "Update linked document..."
2. The second, and slightly more permanent way (until the maintainer of the custom feature creates a new version), is by right clicking any of the featurescript icons in your toolbar or in the custom features dropdown and clicking "Update..." or "Update all..." From there, you can see the current versions of the custom features you have added to your profile and update selected ones to use the current latest version when you use a featurescript.
