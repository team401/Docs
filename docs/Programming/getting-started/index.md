# Getting Started

Follow the steps in this document to begin contributing to robot software projects on the team.

## Create GitHub Account

First, you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com) in order to access the code repositories the team uses. Give your username to the lead programmer or a programming mentor and they will add you to the GitHub organization.

## Install Required Software

Next, download the required software:

- [Installing Git](installing-git.md)
- [Installing WPILib](installing-wpilib.md)

After these programs are installed, your development environment is ready to use.

### Install Optional Software

Consider installing some of the [Optional Software](optional-software.md) as needed. Normally you do not need to do this unless you are the lead programmer or if you are working on specific hardware.

## Learn the Language

On 401, we use Java to program the robot. If you're coming from AP CSA, read the [Post-CSA Supplement](post-csa.md). Otherwise, please learn Java.

## Understand the Process

Becoming familiar with the following resources is required before contributing to the repository:

- The [Software Development Workflow](../software-workflow.md) defines the process for making code changes on the team.
- Learn about our [Coding Standards](../coding-standards.md) to ensure your code passes review.

## Understand our Library: Coppercore

Coppercore is our way of keeping useful code the same year-year. Classes in this library help find locations on a field, add deadbands to joysticks, and interface with wpilib

### Use Coppercore in a new project
