# Basic Electrical Theory

Electricity, in simplest terms, is defined as the movement of charge from positive to negative. Electric current refers to the flow of said charge. This page gives a basic overview of important concepts and formulas relating to electricity.

## Definitions

There are four important quantities used to describe electricity:

- Voltage, which is defined as "an electromotive force or potential difference expressed in volts." It describes the amount of work needed to move a point charge from one location to another.
- Current, which refers to the rate at which charge flows through an electric circuit. This is measured in amperes.
- Resistance, which refers to the circuitâ€™s resistance of current flow. This quantity is measured in ohms.
  - Resistors are components used in circuits in order to divide voltage.
- Power, which is defined as the "rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit." The SI unit for power is the watt, or one joule/second.

There are two types of electric current: DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current). DC flows in only one direction and retains a constant polarity, while AC changes direction and changes polarity. AC is able to carry higher voltages than DC over longer distances.

The only type of current used in FIRST Robotics is DC.

## Series and Parallel Circuits

There are two types of basic circuits which are important to cover before discussing formulas and their applications.

A series circuit consists of components wired in series, or one after the other, following the power supply. Here is an example of a DC series circuit:

In this image, current moves through three components with known resistance values.

Unlike a series circuit, a parallel circuit consists of branching paths from the power supply. The following is an example of a DC parallel circuit:

It is important to note the differences between each type of circuit with respect to voltage and current: a series circuit will have a consistent current between components and the voltage for each component will vary, while a parallel circuit will have divided current between the branching paths and consistent voltage for each component.

## Important Formulas 

There are several important formulas for understanding the relationship between voltage, current, resistance, and power.

### Ohm's Law

$$V = I*R$$ 

Where V represents voltage, I represents current, and R represents resistance.
