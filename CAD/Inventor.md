# Autodesk Inventor

Inventor is the primary CAD program used by Team 401. Inventor is great for two dimensional and three dimensional designs. 

Students can get Inventor for free for personal use from Autodesk: [https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional), and Inventor is pre-installed on most of the school computers used by team members. 

Currently the team is using Autodesk Inventor **2018**, please be sure not to use a newer version of the software for team work as files are not backwards compatible.

When using Inventor on the team most work will be done inside of an Inventor project. Projects solve a lot of problems with file locations and make using our COTS Part Library easy, but can also raise a few issues. When opening a robot project for the first time on a new computer team members will need to modify their Inventor project to correctly link to the Parts Library. Failure to do so will cause all COTS parts to not load into assemblies and will result in many, many error pop-up windows.
