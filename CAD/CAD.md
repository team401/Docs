# CAD

CAD (computer-aided design) is one of the most important parts of Team 401 and is critical to our engineering process. Through CAD we can sketch ideas, work out geometry, find interference issues, visualize interactions, design parts, make drawings, generate G-Code, and test designs in Finite Element Analysis.

## Software we use:

* Autodesk Inventor
* HSM Ultimate
* AutoCAD Electrical
* [GrabCAD](GrabCAD.md)

## CAD Topics:
* [Repository Structuring](CAD-Repository-Structuring.md)
